## What is AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)

1. Ability to reproduce human intelligence and capabilities in machines.
2. Capabilities include:
   1. Learn new skills through observation.
   2. Understand abstract concepts and apply reasoning.
   3. Communicate using a language and understand the nonverbal cues, such as facial recognition, tone variation, and body language.
   4. Handle complex situations in real time.
   5. Plan for short and long-term situations or projects.
   6. Create music and art or invent something new.
3. Need for AI:
   1. Automation and decision making.
   2. Creative support.
4. AI examples: language translation, image classification, text-to-speech, product recommendations, anomaly detection, self-driving cars, weather forecasting, image from text.
5. Language AI models refer to artificial intelligence models that are specifically designed to understand, process, and generate natural language.
6. Deep Learning Models used for language AI models:
   1. Recurrent neural networks, which process data sequentially and store hidden states.
   2. Long short-term memory, which processes data sequentially and can retain the context better through the use of gates.
   3. Transformers, which process data in parallel.
7. ML (Machine Learning) is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that enable machines to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data.Algorithms learn from past data and predict outcomes and trends.
8. DL (Deep Learning) is a subfield of ML that uses neural networks with many layers, deep neural networks, to learn and make sense of complex patterns in data.
