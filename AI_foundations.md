## What is AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)

1. Ability to reproduce human intelligence and capabilities in machines.
2. Capabilities include:
   1. Learn new skills through observation.
   2. Understand abstract concepts and apply reasoning.
   3. Communicate using a language and understand the nonverbal cues, such as facial recognition, tone variation, and body language.
   4. Handle complex situations in real time.
   5. Plan for short and long-term situations or projects.
   6. Create music and art or invent something new.
3. Need for AI:
   1. Automation and decision making.
   2. Creative support.
4. AI examples: language translation, image classification, text-to-speech, product recommendations, anomaly detection, self-driving cars, weather forecasting, and image from text.
5. Language AI models refer to artificial intelligence models that are specifically designed to understand, process, and generate natural language.
6. Deep Learning Models used for language AI models:
   1. Recurrent neural networks, which process data sequentially and store hidden states.
   2. Long short-term memory, which processes data sequentially and can retain the context better through the use of gates.
   3. Transformers, which process data in parallel.
7. ML (Machine Learning) is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms that enable machines to learn from and make predictions or decisions based on data. Algorithms learn from past data and predict outcomes and trends.
8. DL (Deep Learning) is a subfield of ML that uses neural networks with many layers, deep neural networks, to learn and make sense of complex patterns in data.
9. Training a model:
   1. Defining features are the input data to the model.
   2. The label is the corresponding output, also provided by the user.
   3. The machine learning model is trained with this data set.
   4. The training data set consists of a set of features and output labels and is given as an input to the machine learning model.
   5. In training, the model learns between the input features and the output label. Once it is trained, it is called a trained model.
   6. Inference is a process of getting a prediction by giving a data point.
10. Types of Machine Learning:
    1. In supervised machine learning, labeled data is used to train the model. Model learns the relation between features and labels.
    2. Unsupervised learning is generally used to understand relationships within a data set. Labels are not used or are not available.
    3. Reinforcement learning uses algorithms that learn from outcomes to make decisions or choices.
11. Types of Supervised learning: Regression, Classification.
    1. In a supervised machine learning model, the output can be either categorical or continuous.
    2. When the output is continuous, we use regression to predict a numeric output.
    3. When the output is categorical, we use classification to predict a category or a label.
    4. In classification, there are binary and multi-class.
    5. Logistic Regression is a binary classification algorithm commonly used in Machine Learning to predict binary outcomes.
    6. Sigmoidal function to predict the probability of a binary outcome. The sigmoidal function, often represented as the sigmoid function, has an S-shaped curve that maps any input value to an output value between 0 and 1.
    7. Linear Regression is a regression algorithm used for predicting continuous numerical values by modeling the relationship between dependent and independent variables using a straight line.
    8. Decision Tree Classification is also used for classification tasks, not regression.
12. Clustering is the grouping of similar data items. The data items are more similar within a cluster than outside it.
13. Workflow of Unsupervised Workflow:
    1. Prepare the data: Remove missing values, normalize the data, and perform feature scaling.
    2. Create similarity metrics: Choose similarity based on the nature of the data and clustering algorithm used.
    3. Run clustering algorithm: Use the similarity matrix to cluster the data.
    4. Cluster algorithms: partition-based, hierarchical-based, density-based, and distribution-based.
    5. Interpret the results and adjust clustering by iteratively experimenting.
    6. K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering data points, not for regression.
14. Reinforcement learning:
    1. A type of machine learning that enables an agent to learn from its interaction with the environment while receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties without any labeled data.
    2. Agent: A learner or decision maker that interacts with the environment, takes actions, and learns from the feedback received.
    3. Environment: The external system with which the agent interacts.
    4. Action: Is a set of possible moves or decisions that the agent can take in a given state. Actions have an impact on the environment and influence future states.
    5. Policy: A strategy or mapping that the agent uses to decide which action to take in a given state. It defines the agent's behavior and determines how it selects actions.
